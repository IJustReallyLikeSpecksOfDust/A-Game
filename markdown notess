## most basic syntax
re: this;

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}

c# uses these {}
namespaces are for organisation
classes are realllllly complicated. but like... they're groups of types of objects? i learn more about this later
main makes any code inside it's {} be executed. also complex
console is a class inside system. it has a WriteLine method used for... take a wild guess
if you omit 'using system' you can instead do 'System.Console.WriteLine'

also i havent installed c# correctly bcz i can't bcz of permissions on the computer

Console.WriteLine() is basically c#'s print(). it works with maths like print.

there's also Console.Write which is the same but it doesnt make a new line
// is c#'s comments. for multiline comments start with /* and end with */



## variable stuff
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
long - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123. can use far higher numbers than int (int is capped at ~ 2.1b)
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false

add 'const' infront of a variable to make it impossible to edit
to use regular text and a variable in a write() use +
  same goes for two variables

To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:
  int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;

also variable names are called identifiers

Casting is how you assign one variable to another type of variable.
  int cheeseamount = 4;
  double cheeseeaten = cheeseamount;
  // there's also explicit casting (this example is implicit)

For conversions use:
Convert.ToBoolean(), Convert.ToDouble(), Convert.ToString(), Convert.ToInt32(), Convert.ToInt64()

Console.ReadLine() is for user input
  string input = Console.Readline();
readline's values are strings. use conversions if needed.

to modify assigned integers, use things such as +=

## loop stuff

while loops are real simple. just this:
  while (condition) 
  {
    // code block to be executed
  }

also there's this thing. do while
  do 
  {
    // code block to be executed
  }
  while (condition);

seemingly just a regular while loop with different order.

for loops are a bit more complicated.

statement one just gets executed. statement 2 checks the truth. statement 3 modifies something.

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) 
{
  // code block to be executed
}

foreach is for data usually. arrays. it's just 'for each thing in other thing, execute'

break exits a loop. continue skips one instance of the loop. they work in while loops also.


## other things
methods are like functions but they aren't. i think i can just treat them as functions though. heres the how to
  class Program
  {
    static void methodname() 
    {
      // code to be executed
    }
  }

they're definetely more complicated than this but this is the basic whatever. link for parameters cuz i didnt make notes https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_method_parameters.php


i'm going to have to use files to save later so here's work with files. https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_files.php
