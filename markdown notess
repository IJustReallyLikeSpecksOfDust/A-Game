re: this;

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}

c# uses these {}
namespaces are for organisation
classes are realllllly complicated. but like... they're groups of types of objects? i learn more about this later
main makes any code inside it's {} be executed. also complex
console is a class inside system. it has a WriteLine method used for... take a wild guess
if you omit 'using system' you can instead do 'System.Console.WriteLine'

also i havent installed c# correctly bcz i can't bcz of permissions on the computer

Console.WriteLine() is basically c#'s print(). it works with maths like print.

there's also Console.Write which is the same but it doesnt make a new line
// is c#'s comments. for multiline comments start with /* and end with */
